    <string name="help_text">The object of the game is to get 4 of your cups in a row. Two players each have 12 inverted cups initially arranged in 3 nested stacks off the board. White moves first. Cups may be placed over smaller cups. Cups moved from off the board must be placed on an empty position unless the cup they cover is one of an opposing 3-in-a-row.
You lose if you uncover a win unless you can cover another cup in the win. Draws can occur by agreement or by moves repeated 3 times. If you cannot place a lifted piece you lose.

Gobblet was designed by Thierry Denoual, co-founder of Blue Orange Games.</string>
